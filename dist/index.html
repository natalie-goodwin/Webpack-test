       <!--Think of components as pieces you will reuse; you don't 
            have to break it down to the smallest component possible; 
            a like button can be reused; size of a component isn't as 
            important as reusability; navbars, buttons, links, and 
            containers are all components; think about if it will be 
            used on the site one time, or is it reusable; 
            try to build functional components even if class
            is being used because you don't know where 
            you are going to work; classes are cleaner
            looking than functional 
        
            State hooks and effect hooks are most
            commonly used-->
